			<p>  Over the summer my younger brother, Luke, has been doing an engineering internship in Salt Lake City, Utah. Since I have a flexible job and some free time I have been tasked to fly out to Utah and the road trip back with him (it’s possible my parents don’t trust him to drive home alone). This map shows my extensive travels over the next two weeks.  </p>

		<h3> Days 2-3: Columbus, IN </h3>
<p> I will be staying in Indiana for a few days, during which I will be working remotely, cuddling my cats, and enjoying the fact my parents will be doing all the cooking for me. </p>

<h3> Day 4: Indiana to Salt Lake City </h3>
<p> Despite the fact my apartment is 5 miles from Chicago O’Hare airport it was somehow cheaper to fly out of the Indianapolis airport. I fly from Indianapolis to LAX, where I will have a hopefully chill 90-minute layover before flying to Salt Lake City. </p>

<h3>Day 5: Salt Lake City </h3>
<p>My brother has to work this day, so I will enjoy seeing Salt Lake City and seeing if their public transportation system is more reliable than the CTA. Apparently, my brother is throwing a party in the evening that I am not invited to. I plan on crashing said party. </p>

<h3>Day 6: Arches National Park </h3>
<p>We will leave Salt Lake City and go to Arches National Park near Moab, UT. Despite the fact I am not an outdoorsy person I feel obligated to at least go to one national park while I am out them. </p>

<h3>Day 7: Denver</h3>
<p>We begin the trek home and plan on stopping overnight in Denver.</p>

<h3>Day 8: Kansas City</h3>
<p>Another full day of driving, mostly through Kansas which is not a super fun drive. </p>

<h3>Day 9+: Home</h3>
<p>We will arrive back in Indiana, where I will stay a few more days to see some friends and family. And also cuddle my cats some more before I head back to Chicago. </p>
